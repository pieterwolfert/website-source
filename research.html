      <p>At the moment the main focus of my research is equipping humanoid robots with
        non-verbal behavior that appears to be natural for humans. When we humans communicate with each other, we use different
        channels to convey our message, one of which is the use of non-verbal behavior.</p>

      <p>First, the focus is on the development of machine learning algorithms
        that will learn the relation between language and non-verbal behavior.
        Second, these algorithms will be evaluated by having humans rate the behavior of these robots.
        Lastly, we hope to learn more about human-robot interaction. For example, we are interested in the human perception and use of non-verbal communication when communicating with these type of humanoid robots.</p>
